# Gutemberg

This is a 2-hour POC to see if indexing an ebook makes any sense.

I downloaded [A Tale of Two
Cities](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-h/98-h.htm) from the [Gutemberg
Project](http://www.gutenberg.org/) and parsed it then pushed it to Algolia and
made a quick UI to search into it.
